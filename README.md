# LeagueProject

## Description
This is a personal project that I will be creating. This document will work as a general planning guide and then after the project it will be transformed into a proper ReadMe file. What I will be trying to do is use 2 APIs to create an application do 2 main things, one is finding artist similar to the ones the use says they like and the second is getting information about if a user's liked artist and recommended artist are going to have an event nearby (or just in certain towns if the API does not work with nearby, and I will try to figure out nearby later).
